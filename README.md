We investigate 4 ML techniques: logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and extreme gradient boost. First, these classifiers are trained on two unbalanced fraud detection datasets: phishing website URLs and fraudulent credit card transactions. Then, three synthetically balanced datasets are produced for each original data set by implementing the sampling frameworks: RandomUnderSampler, SMOTE, and SMOTEENN. The optimum hyperparameters for all the 16 experiments are revealed using the method RandomzedSearchCV. A comparative analysis of all 16 approaches are performed using AUC-ROC and AUC-PR.
